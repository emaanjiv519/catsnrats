Cats N' Rats
A Pac-Man-inspired game with a creative twist!

Cats N' Rats is a reimagined version of the classic arcade game Pac-Man. Created as part of Northeastern University's EECE 2140: Computing Fundamentals for Engineers course, 
this project blends technical programming skills with artistic creativity. The game features custom-designed sprites, interactive gameplay mechanics, and a whimsical theme 
where players navigate as a rat, collecting cheese and avoiding cats. Itâ€™s an engaging way to learn game development, showcasing both collaboration and innovation.
